Initial Dataset Documentation 
Process and Choices

Our data gathering process included tracking NBA players' social media frequency throughout their regular season. We used X’s advanced search feature to analyze each player's social media postings from 10/19/21 - 4/10/22. These dates represented the start and end dates of the 2021-2022 NBA regular season. We chose this criteria in order to search for potential correlations between social media activity and regular season performance. To narrow in on this correlation we focused on gathering data from both the top and bottom 5 winningest teams from this season. An initial challenge we faced was encountering burner accounts trying to replicate the professional athletes on X. We quickly fixed this after learning more about X’s advanced search feature which would neglect all affiliated accounts besides our verified athlete. 

Content Description

Our dataset shows how often the starting five players from the top and bottom five NBA teams in the 2021-22 season posted on X. To keep our dataset consistent, we used basketballreference.com to identify each team's most common starting lineup for the regular season. Since the highest-paid and most influential players typically start, we wanted to explore any correlation between these key players.

Responsibility and Contributions

For tracking social media activity, we assigned 2 teams to each group member. After uploading our data in excel we discussed our findings by comparing each team's total frequency throughout their starting 5 players. 

Our Findings

After gathering our data we found the top 5 teams tweeted 1,169 compared to the bottom 5 tweeting 295 times. This is a massive 4x difference in social media frequency. Given the context of the NBA this statistic makes sense, considering that the popular, higher profile players play for big market teams which are typically successful during the regular season. Also, losing on a professional level can lead to turmoil and decreased team morale throughout a long NBA season. The bottom of the NBA is commonly filled with younger teams who are figuring out their way in the league. This combination of being inexperienced, less marketable and a part of a losing organization can lead to decreased confidence and focus in your public social media presence.
