We had to collect social media data of the 5 starting players in each of the 2 teams. The amount of teams couldn't be evenly divided, so massive thanks to Haydyn for stepping up and doing the rest of the missing teams.

## Weekly Summary:
*Try to answer the following questions as best you can, though you are welcome to keep it brief and in bullet points.*

- What were the goals for this week for the group project?
      The main goal that our group had for this week was to revise our initial project proposal. Our feedback revealed that we were off on a lot of the marks for the project. We need to rework our scope and outcome for the project. We also figured out that our volunteer system for PM was not going to work. There was a lot to revise for our project this week.

- What has been accomplished?
      We rewrote our initial project plan completely. Some previous ideas were salvaged, others were left behind. I think we have more of a structured project now. We're focusing on social media presence and its correlation with team performance across seasons.

- Any problems or issues that need resolving?
      Not yet, but I'm sure something will come up eventually.


## Next Week's Goals:
*Try to answer the following questions as best you can, though you are welcome to keep it brief and in bullet points.*

- What are the goals for the upcoming week?
      Continue working on the project, attempt to start creating the actual dataset to fulfil the project & research question scope.

- Who is assigned to what tasks? (ideally)
      -Every member in the group will scrape data from a social media platform in order to start developing our dataset. Gathering data is our number one priority at the moment because we need a dataset to show by Oct 22nd. So, I feel that it is best to gather the data now and then we can clean and verify the data in the coming weeks.
