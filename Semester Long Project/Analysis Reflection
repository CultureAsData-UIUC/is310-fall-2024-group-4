Reflecting on our project, our team faced several challenges that shifted our approach. Initially, we explored topic modeling as a method to gather insights. After analyzing further, we found the context of our dataset wouldn’t deliver valuable insights through topic modeling, which led us to focus on statistical analysis. Topic modeling is used for textual information but our dataset requires a method to analyze numerical information. Next, we decided to add another season to our dataset in order to have a greater context of the engagement metrics we were looking at. We divided our workload by having each group member gather data for two more NBA teams within the 2022-2023 season. 
Moving forward, we can add onto our work by analyzing additional seasons. This can be particularly interesting because of how rapidly Twitter as a platform has changed throughout the recent decade. This would allow us to compare engagement metrics of these players during the season throughout different era’s and stigmas around social media. The NBA has been around for 79 seasons, which makes our group curious as to if the pioneers of the social media era had a greater correlation towards regular season success in comparison to today. 
Additionally, refining our dataset to include keywords or hashtags would allow us to analyze common trends amongst the league. For example, we would be able to contextualize whether the players with high quantity and engagement on Twitter was mainly because of paid promotion, or authentically tweeting their ideas. 
In conclusion, this project gives us a strong foundation for understanding the connection between social media engagement and team performance. Through expanding our dataset, adding new methods there is a ton of potential to uncover valuable insights for both social media and the NBA.
