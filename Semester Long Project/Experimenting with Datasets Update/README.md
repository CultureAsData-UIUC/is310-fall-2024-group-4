# Experimenting With Datasets

This directory contains the experiments we conducted on our dataset for the final group project checkpoint.

# Division of Labour

Each group member will upload a file containing the work they did to experiment on our dataset. Our work will be done in a Python notebook.

# Documenting the Process
The process started off with some reflection on current methodologies and dataset. We found that our data set was not fully compatable with our original plan so we decided to switch gears and do a more statistical analysis approach. 
First we loaded the data and filtered it into two different Data Frames, one for the 2021-2022 season and one for the 2022-2023 season. Then we used groupby to group Team and Season and total number of tweets in each category. This data is sorted by Rank which is another value added to describe the rank of the teams. These same steps are repeated for both seasons. Then we decided to create Bar plots to show us the rankings for each team comparative to the number of tweets that team has. The x ais was used to represent the Team and Season, while the y axis represented the number of tweets from the team. This brings us to our original purpose of doing this research, which is to find correlation between a teams engagemnet with fans and their performance. The bars are ranked from top to bottom teams performances so it allows us to see who did the best and worst comparatively. 
We decided to go and add another extra visualization technique which involves utilizing pie charts. We grouped the data by Team, Season, and Team Rank. Then the total number of tweets is summed for each of the groups and this nets us with a dataframe. Then we loop through each season and filter out the data sorting it by number of tweets for each season. The pie chart is created and we can see the distributon of tweets from differetn teams for each season. 


The way the labor was organized was for each person to first take a step back and do research on what statsical analysis really is. In order to do a good analysis, we need to understand what that term really means. After this we got together and came up with an effective solution to combine all our ideas. We decided for each person to perform their own statistical analysis, and then come together and combine the results. The analysis didn't have to be perfect, but comprehensible. After a long time we had come to the results of what we have now.
