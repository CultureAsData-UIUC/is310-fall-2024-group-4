# Instructor Feedback on Experimenting with Datasets Update

## General Comments

Overall, I appreciated your very detailed and thoughtful documentation––the requirements in the `README.md` was a nice touch––and I'm impressed with how you've expanded the project since your last update! I thought your assessment of needing to pivot slightly was great and very helpful for the project, and particularly, the shift from topic modeling to statistical analyses though I am bit confused what you were ever planning to topic model? Do you mean just clustering?

Regardless, I also liked how you organized and divided the work for this assignment, essentially having each of you test out the methods to ensure that you all had a good understanding of the data and the methods. It would be helpful to have a bit more detail on who did what for example, but again impressed with your thoughtful revisions and the work you've done so far!

## Specific Feedback

### Alan_Exploration Notebook

This notebook is well-documented and organized, with clear headers and comments that make it easy to follow. Your initial exploration of the data was solid, and I appreciated your insights into trends around tweets by teams versus players.

One area to consider expanding: Are the most active teams being driven by one or two prolific players, or is the activity more evenly distributed across the team? Adding an analysis of the number of players tweeting by team would provide a clearer picture. Great job overall, Alan!

### AlexGuzmanExperimenting Notebook

This notebook also worked well, and I was impressed with your analysis. I thought you might also want to calculate the standard deviation of the number of tweets by team, as that could give you a sense of how much variation there is in the number of tweets by team. This could be particularly interesting if you're looking at the number of tweets by team over time, as you could see if there are certain teams that tweet more consistently than others. 

I also appreciated your analysis of the data and your use of linear regression to try to understand the relationship between the number of tweets and the number of wins. I think your work raises some interesting questions about why is there so little correlation between the number of tweets and the number of wins, perhaps something you could consider or speculate on more in your final project submission. Again, well done, Alex!

### JustingB_Experimenting Notebook

Unfortunately, your notebook produced an error when I tried to open it in VS Code or Jupyter, so it was difficult to fully assess your work. I was able to view it in a text editor, and from what I saw, your code and analysis appeared sound.

Your use of correlation analysis makes sense, and I appreciate that you included plots to visualize the data. I recommend fixing the rendering issue so your notebook is easier to review. Your assessment of factors influencing tweet activity was thoughtful, and I encourage you to include this in your final project submission. Keep up the good work, Justin!

### StatisticalAnalysisHaydnElm Notebook

This notebook was very impressive! I hadn’t come across `bqplot` before, so great job introducing that. Your code worked seamlessly, and the notebook was well-organized with clear visualizations and insightful analysis.

From your findings, it seems clear that simply being on a team isn’t a significant predictor of tweet activity. This raises an interesting question: What metadata could better predict tweet behavior? Speculating on what additional data might be useful would be a valuable addition to your final project. Excellent work, Haydn!

## For Final Project Submission

For your final project submission, I encourage you to incorporate your analyses and visualizations, as well as your findings and interpretations. I think your assessments and code will be very helpful to future users of your dataset!

I also thought your reflections on the process were very insightful, and I recommend expanding on those in your final project submission. Additionally, consider incorporating relevant peer-reviewed scholarship from the *Computing Cultural Data* assignment to provide further context for your dataset and guide others in using it responsibly. Overall, very pleased with this progress, and I'm excited to see how everything comes together!
