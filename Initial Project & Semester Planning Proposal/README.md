# NBA Social Media Presence

## Topics

The idea of data and culture sparked the idea of social media in our heads. It is immeasurable how important social media is to every NBA team; maintaining engagement from the fans is essential to the team's success, including motivation, performance, earning money, reputation, and more.

Thus, we chose to explore the impact social media, an ordeal played outside the court, has on the NBA. We hope to understand how every team in the league has utilized their social media outlets and see how it affects their performance and success. **Based on their social media and performance in games, which teams in the league are the most dominant or successful in the NBA?**

Our group is focused on examining the social media presence of every NBA team, and how their utilization of their social media platforms translates back onto the court. What's the relationship between the team's performance in the NBA, such as wins in playoffs or points scored, and their usage of their social media platforms?

## Materials

We don't expect to handle any physical objects as our scope focuses on the recent bouts of the NBA, where everything has been recorded and posted digitally.

However, we understand that statistics for teams have historically been collected manually such as handwritten statbooks. It wasn't until recent decades we started to see the mass digitization of NBA statistics. Therefore, we aim to compile existing digital data, such as metrics on a team's social media and performance, into an augmented dataset that'll guide us in finding the answer to our question.

Social media is a numbers game, so we foresee us taking a look at metrics like followers, reposts, like counts, and shares over time.


## Division of Labor

After [spinning a wheel](https://wheelofnames.com) to determining the order of project managers, our weekly rotation of project managers is as follows:

#### Ahmad S -> Haydn E -> Alex G -> Justin B -> Alan K -> Ahmad S -> and so on...

We will cycle back to the first person after each person has been PM once.

Each week will have some large goal that we want to accomplish as a group. The PM for the week will delegate components of the larger tasks to group members who specialize in accomplishing them.

Some of us are more knowledgeable about the NBA itself than working with Git/Github and vice versa. 

For example, we delegated the role of finding essential NBA statistics that we should collect to Justin and Haydn. They were more knowledgeable on what statistics determine a team's success, as we were measuring how successful a team is as a part of our project.
