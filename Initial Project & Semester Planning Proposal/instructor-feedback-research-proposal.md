## Instructor Feedback on Initial IS310 Project Proposal

Overall, your group has selected an interesting topic that seems relevant to the course and project requirements, and has potential to become a very exciting final project. Your focus on basketball statistics is an interesting and relevant choice, especially given the rich history of data collection in basketball. I also appreciated your attention to the timeline for submitting project milestones. However, there are several areas where your proposal could be refined to ensure the scope is manageable and that you meet the course’s requirements:

- **Group Logistics & Division of Labor**: I appreciate that you have a plan for communication and project management, but I would recommend being more specific about how you plan to ensure that the project manager role is shared among group members. Usually volunteer basis leads to one person always being the project manager, so I would recommend thinking about how you might rotate this role or share responsibilities more evenly. You also did not include any discussion of division of labor which is a requirement for the project, so I would highly recommend taking some time to discuss how you will work and actually creating a plan where group members are assigned tasks. In particular, I would recommend considering how you will divide work in a way that ensures that if a task takes longer than expected that the project can still continue. I noticed you have used the GitHub Project Board to track but that there is not many issues posted, so I would recommend using it to track your progress and assign tasks, as this will help you stay organized and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

- **Project Proposal Structure & Clarity**: I find the setup of your proposal a bit confusing. What is Part 2 exactly? It seems like you're discussing the digital object you found, but it's not clear how this relates to your project proposal. You also mention "virality" of certain games, but that is not a requirement of the project so could you clarify why that is relevant and how that relates to the proposed plan for the project? Furthermore, the website you list basketball reference does not allow for web scraping (you can read their terms of service and we'll be discussing this topic in class next week [https://www.sports-reference.com/data_use.html](https://www.sports-reference.com/data_use.html)), so you'll need to consider how you'll work with this data. You could still use it with manual collection or perhaps use it as a comparison to other datasets you find that are more easily scraped. I do appreciate that you mention some free digital libraries for sports statistics, so it seems like maybe you were aware on the prohibition of scraping basketball reference but it would be helpful if you were explicit in your proposal about how you plan to work with this data. For example, you write "After a little bit of searching, I could not find a service that provides stats on basketball for a paid fee or subscription." and I'm confused why that would be a goal for this project? I do not recommend paying for data for this project and though I cannot outright prohibit it, I will say that it will make releasing your project almost impossible since most for-profit data does not allow public release. 

- **Historical Context & Synergy Sports Technology**: I appreciate the historical context you provide about the NBA and the evolution of data collection in basketball. This is a great way to contextualize your project and show the importance of your research question. However, I would recommend focusing more on how this historical context relates to your project proposal. For example, are you planning to look at the original historical objects like stat books and physical film? I would recommend revising this section to make sure it's clear how the historical context you provide relates to your project proposal. Similarly, your discussion of Synergy Sports Technology is helpful but are you planning to try and access this data? And if yes, how will you do so? I would recommend clarifying how this tool fits into your project and how you plan to use it.

- **Research Question & Scope**: You mention that you want to focus on "average height of an NBA team to win rate of that team in one year", however, I'm a bit concerned that this doesn't really clearly seem to engage with the project requirements of either creating new data or augmenting existing data. While I do think it is important to have a focus to help scope your project, I think it would be helpful to think about how your research question corresponds to the data work required for the project. My sense is you want to use existing basketball stats data and plan to start investigating the original cultural phenomena that is represented in those datasets, but what comes after that seems a bit unclear. How do you plan to augment these datasets and which ones do you even plan to use? I would recommend revising your proposed plan to make sure it's clear how you plan to engage with the project requirements and how you plan to create or augment data. This revision will also help create a more detailed timeline and start dividing tasks appropriately.

Overall, I think you have a strong foundation for your project, but I would recommend focusing on refining your project proposal structure, clarifying your research question and scope, and creating a more detailed division of labor and timeline. If you have any questions or need further guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Good work so far!
