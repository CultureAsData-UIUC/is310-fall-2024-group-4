To be updated with a description for a collaborative semester long project

## Tentative Group Members

These members were selected because of your broad interests in sports, gaming culture, and even E-sports. You are not required to keep your group focused on this area for this project, but I share this broad overview to hopefully help spark initial brainstorming together.

_Please note this list of members is tentative and subject to change as students join or leave the class in the next week or so._

- Justin B.
- Haydn E.
- Alex G.
- Alan K.
- Ahmad S.
