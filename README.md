The idea of data and culture sparked the concept of social media in our heads. It is immeasurable how important social media is to every NBA team; maintaining engagement from the fans is essential to the team's success, including motivation, performance, earning money, reputation, and more.

Thus, we chose to explore social media's impact on the NBA, an ordeal played outside the court. We hope to understand how every team in the league has utilized their social media outlets and see how it affects their performance and success. We would examine which way the relationship is: How does fan engagement on an NBA team's social media change after the team's performance, such as wins/loss? or How does fan engagement on the social media of NBA teams affect their results in actual games?

Our group is committed to learning and discovering if there is a pattern or correlation between social media activity and performance within an NBA season.
