## Selecting and Accessing a Platform

### Choosing a Platform

Our platform of choice is [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/). It's social media platform that hosts a wide variety of content, including sports, which will be helpful for our group project.

We want to collect the following metrics: followers, likes, views, genre, and personal ratings (whether or not the reel reached the goal of entertaining us). We determined that these were good metrics for the task at hand.

### Accessing the Platform

We found some [published guidelines](https://transparency.meta.com/researchtools/meta-content-library) from Meta detailing the procedure for accessing information on Instagram

**We're unable to find how these guidelines have changed in the past year because as of 10/11/2024, the Wayback Machine was down. Though, we will update this section when it becomes available again**

> Researchers may apply to request data that would include access to the full public content archive from Instagram. In this case, it lets you “access data that provides for posts shared by and information about business and creator accounts, as well as a subset of personal accounts that have been set to public and have a verified badge or 25,000 or more followers.” 

> This allows for searching and filtering, multimedia, producers list filtering, post trends, downloadable data, and dashboards.

> The Content Library API is designed for programming with R and Python. This includes Endpoints and data fields, search indexing and results, and an asynchronous search. 

> To be eligible to access this information you need to be affiliated with an “ academic institution or other non-university organization, institute, or society which operates as a not-for-profit entity and holds scientific or public interest research as a primary purpose or core activity”

Instagram requires the user to have a registered account in order to get the full features of the platform, including scrolling through its Reels, similar to the short videos of Tik Tok.

We will collect data by treating each short video/"reel" as an entry in the dataset.

## Reflection 

### Augmenting the Data

We chose the subjective column by thinking about a popular metric that is used to determine enjoyment or satisfaction. We came up with ratings because it is very subjective and differs from person to person. One of the group members looked at the ratings differently and thought it would be how well the video did compared to the views it had. The way the other group members rated the video is how relevant we thought the video was and how much we enjoyed it regardless of other people's opinions. 

Instagram allows users to see followers, likes, comments, shares, and finally views. We decided to pick out followers, likes, and views since these are not repeated for each user. With this data, we were able to see the popularity of a video and the account itself and compare the numbers to each other. One difficulty in collecting this data was trying to find the views. To see the views, a user has to go to the accounts page and scroll down until they find that video which then will tell them the number of views before clicking on it. 

We used both quantitative and qualitative data to assess how valuable the reel was to our feed. It was key to note the data we gathered to assess the engagement of each video. Looking at Instagram's algorithm, it can be difficult to correlate high engagement on a video considering the numerous variables influencing how relevant and enjoyable a consumer will rate it. Sponsored content can often prioritize the promotion of a product and many times can come at the cost of user enjoyment. These sponsored posts aim to reach an ideal target audience through Instagram's algorithm, but we can acknowledge they aren’t typically successful when it comes to receiving a high rating from consumers.

### Ethics/Legality

There aren't really any legal or ethical considerations with the creation of this dataset. All these metrics that we chose to collect can be hidden by the creator which would make it so the users are unable to view it. The creator also has an option to make an account private which means that no one but people they approve can view the content they are creating.
