1. How do these datasets differ in how they represent cultural objects or practices?
Compare how the digital object itself and the dataset convey the same cultural artifact. What details are maintained, and what 
are simplified or lost?
The two datasets we picked are the efficiency stats from the Lakers first and last championships. Pure stats like FG%  and FT % 
are maintained, as those are easily calculated from old statbooks by just dividing makes/attempts. However, the 3PT % is 
unavailable for the old championship because it was before the three pointer was invented. 
2. What kind of metadata or context accompanies the data?
Evaluate the transparency of the dataset about its origins, creation, and curation process. Is there sufficient context provided 
to fully understand the cultural object?
	The dataset about Lakers First Championship seems to be transparent. We can see that the data was collected by a company 
called SportRadar, which is the official partner of NBA, NHL, and MLB. This is good credentials for trusting this source. This 
data contains information from 1948-49. We can see from this information that the data set contains transparency about where it 
comes from, and how it was created. 
3. Does the dataset reflect any power structures or biases?
Discuss how the dataset’s structure, curation, or presentation reflects specific power structures. Consider who controls the 
dataset, what narratives it promotes, and whose perspectives are centered or marginalized.
These datasets seem to be accurate, but you can’t be sure without watching the old game tapes. There has been some controversy 
recently about how Micheal Jordan’s defensive stats were inflated due to the Chicago stat keepers boosting his numbers when he 
played at home to make him seem even better,  and without the game footage it is impossible to say if the Lakers were honest. 
4. Are there any notable gaps in the data?
Analyze what might be missing from the dataset that was part of the digital object. Why do you think this data is missing? Is it 
due to technical limitations, a lack of value, or active suppression?
	Our old efficiency data is missing 3PT% because the three point line didn’t exist yet, so I guess it’s kind of a 
technical limitation. If you look outside of pure efficiency stats into advanced statistics, the new data has a ton of extra 
stats like offensive and defensive ratings. These are missing due to technical limitations and a lack of value. With old stat 
keepers writing by hand, these complex calculations take in so many variables that it would be unrealistic to calculate them for 
every team. Also, as the sport evolved and teams got better, more focus on efficiency and the most effective way to win games was 
emphasized more than in the past, similar to Moneyball (baseball movie) portrays finding underpaid players to overperform to be 
the most efficient.

AI Analysis
Old Dataset Summary:
The Old Dataset represents player performance statistics that include limited shooting data, specifically lacking insights into 
3-point shooting accuracy. The average field goal percentage (FG%) is recorded at 34.5%, indicating an overall below-average 
shooting efficiency. The free throw percentage (FT%) is somewhat more reliable at 71.9%, reflecting decent performance from the 
free-throw line. However, the 3-point percentage (3P%) data is largely incomplete or non-existent, suggesting either a lack of 
focus on 3-point attempts or poor tracking of this metric. Overall, the dataset lacks depth and offers minimal insights into 
perimeter shooting.
New Dataset Summary:
The New Dataset showcases significant improvements in both the quality and range of the shooting data. The average FG% has risen 
to 45.9%, indicating much better scoring efficiency across the board. This could reflect an improvement in player skill or a 
shift in offensive strategy. The 3P% is now available at 33.9%, offering a clearer picture of long-range shooting ability, which 
sits at a respectable level for average performance. Additionally, the FT% has improved slightly to 74.6%, signaling increased 
consistency at the free-throw line. In contrast to the Old Dataset, this dataset provides a more complete and useful breakdown of 
shooting performance, especially with the addition of the 3-point percentage.
Comparison Summary:
Between the two datasets, there is a noticeable enhancement in data completeness and performance. The New Dataset offers a more 
holistic view of shooting statistics, including 3-point accuracy, which was absent in the Old Dataset. The FG% has increased by 
over 11%, and the FT% has also improved, pointing to overall better shooting capabilities. The inclusion of 3-point shooting data 
in the new set allows for more comprehensive analysis, enabling deeper insights into offensive efficiency and player performance.



1. How does the AI describe the cultural object versus the dataset?
Are there differences in how the AI represents the cultural artifact when describing it as a digital object compared to the 
dataset? What nuances or context is lost in the dataset?
The AI referred to the dataset as a cultural artifact due to its narration and summary of cultural significance. This included 
adding valuable context to the statistics while analyzing the in-game significance the stats reflected. When looking at it as a 
dataset, there was a focus on comparative analysis to leverage the previous numbers to deliver our context. The nuances lost in 
the dataset are reflected in the decades of changes from rules, to athlete habits and more.  The AI’s understanding of how 
basketball has evolved from 1949 gives us insight into how a greater overview of stats to work from.


2. What does the AI’s output reveal about the dataset’s embedded power structures?
Does the AI’s language reflect any inherent biases or reinforce specific power dynamics? How does the AI’s interpretation of the 
dataset compare to the object’s original context?
The AI’s language clearly has a bias towards the newer dataset due to it being more comprehensive and analytical, digging deeper 
into the player’s skills. It includes 3-point accuracy statistic, which the AI particularly likes. The AI’s interpretation of the 
datasets shows an emphasis on player shooting capabilities and performance during the games. This is important because the 
intended purpose of the datasets are to predict and to figure out where players would stand head-to-head and to fuel the 
excitement that players hold for the sport, which may include sports betting.

3. What is potentially missing in the AI-generated descriptions?
Consider whether the AI recognizes or highlights any missing information. Does it attempt to fill in these gaps, and if so, how 
accurate or reflective are these attempts of the original cultural object or practice?
One thing the AI missed out on was the lack of 3PT% in the first Lakers championship. The AI suggests that the Lakers didn't 
shoot any threes or stat keepers didn’t write them in. For the description of the new Lakers, they note that they are better long 
range shooters, which although probably true, cannot be deduced from 3PT % alone. 
4. Does the AI challenge or reinforce existing narratives?
Reflect on whether the AI critiques or reinforces dominant narratives about the cultural object or practice. Does it repeat 
common assumptions, or does it present new insights that challenge the status quo? 
The AI does critique the old dataset stating that the new dataset has a more holistic view of the statistics. It stated that 
there is a big improvement in data completeness and performance. It showcases that players are improving as time goes on, which 
is a common narrative among NBA fans.
